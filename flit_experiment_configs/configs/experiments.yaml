# Experiment Configuration Specifications - Single Source of Truth
# 
# This file defines all experiment parameters in a structured, validated format.
# Each experiment contains complete specifications for:
# - Business context and hypothesis
# - Statistical requirements (power analysis)
# - Population definition and eligibility
# - Treatment variants and implementation
# - Success metrics and guardrails
#
# Design Principles:
# 1. Hypothesis-driven: Every experiment starts with a clear business hypothesis
# 2. Statistical rigor: Proper power analysis drives sample size requirements
# 3. Business safety: Guardrail metrics protect against negative outcomes
# 4. Reproducibility: Complete specifications enable exact replication

  # EXPERIMENT 1: Free Shipping Threshold Optimization
  # =====================================================================================
  # Business Context: Free shipping is the #1 factor in e-commerce purchase decisions
  # Strategic Goal: Optimize the balance between conversion rate and shipping costs
  # Risk Level: Medium (potential margin impact but significant volume opportunity)
  # =====================================================================================

    # === BUSINESS CONTEXT & STRATEGY ===
    business_justification: >
      Free shipping is cited by 87% of consumers as the most important factor in 
      purchase decisions. Current $50 threshold may be too high, causing cart 
      abandonment. Reducing to $35 could increase conversion while maintaining 
      acceptable unit economics. This test directly impacts Q1 revenue targets.
    
    risk_assessment: >
      MEDIUM RISK: Potential 5-10% margin impact if AOV decreases significantly. 
      However, volume increases should offset margin compression. Easily reversible 
      if results are negative. No customer experience or brand risk.
    
    strategic_importance: >
      Primary revenue driver test for Q1. Tests fundamental pricing psychology 
      and price elasticity in our customer base. Results will inform broader 
      pricing strategy and customer acquisition costs.
    
    # === HYPOTHESIS FRAMEWORK ===
    # Primary hypothesis drives the statistical design and success criteria
    # Secondary hypotheses help understand trade-offs and unintended consequences

    hypothesis:
      primary: >
        Reducing free shipping threshold from $50 to $35 will increase conversion 
        rate by 8% relative (4.5% → 4.86%) due to reduced purchase friction
      
      secondary:
        - >
          Average order value will decrease by less than 5% as customers optimize 
          their cart size to the new threshold
        - >
          Revenue per session will increase overall despite AOV decrease due to 
          higher conversion volume
        - >
          Customer satisfaction and repeat purchase behavior will remain stable

        Success is defined as achieving statistical significance (p < 0.05) on the 
        primary conversion rate metric with at least 8% relative improvement, while 
        maintaining all guardrail metrics within acceptable bounds and demonstrating 
        positive ROI through increased revenue per session.
