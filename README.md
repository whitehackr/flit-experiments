## **Mission Statement**

The Flit Experiments repository embodies **data science experimentation practices**, demonstrating sophisticated statistical thinking, rigorous experimental design, and business-oriented decision frameworks. This platform showcases end-to-end experimentation flows from hypothesis formation through business impact measurement.

## **Architecture & Repository Relationship**

### **Multi-Repository Experimentation Ecosystem**

Flit Experiments operates as part of a **distributed data science architecture** designed to mirror real-world enterprise experimentation platforms:

    A[flit-experiments] -->|Experiment Configs| B[flit-data-platform]
    B -->|Generated Data| C[BigQuery Data Warehouse]
    C -->|Analysis Data| A

    A2[Power Analysis] --> A
    A3[Statistical Analysis] --> A
    A4[Business Recommendations] --> A
    
    B1[Data Generation] --> B
    B2[dbt Transformations] --> B
    B3[Data Quality] --> B
```

### **Service Boundaries & Responsibilities**

| Repository | Primary Responsibility | Data Flow |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **flit-experiments** | Experimental design, statistical analysis, business decisions | **Produces** experiment specifications → **Consumes** analysis-ready data |
| **flit-data-platform** | Data generation, transformations, warehouse management | **Consumes** experiment specifications → **Produces** analysis-ready datasets |
| **flit-main** | Orchestration, documentation, deployment | **Consumes** business recommendations → **Produces** strategic direction |

### **Configuration as a Service Pattern**

This repository implements **Configuration as a Service**, where experiment specifications are packaged and versioned for consumption by data engineering systems:

```python
# flit-experiments produces versioned configurations
flit-experiment-configs==1.2.0

# flit-data-platform consumes specific versions
from flit_experiment_configs import get_experiment_config
config = get_experiment_config("free_shipping_threshold_test")
```

**Benefits of this architecture:**
- **🔄 Reproducibility:** Exact experiment specifications are versioned and tracked
- **🚀 Scalability:** Multiple data systems can consume experiment configurations
- **🛡 Change Control:** Configuration changes require explicit version bumps and validation
- **🔗 Loose Coupling:** Experimentation logic is decoupled from data engineering concerns

## **Experimental Methodology**

The experimentation framework demonstrates **advanced statistical thinking** that goes beyond basic A/B testing:

#### **1. Hypothesis-Driven Design**
- **Primary hypotheses** with specific effect size predictions
- **Secondary hypotheses** for understanding trade-offs and unintended consequences  
- **Guardrail metrics** with predefined stop conditions for business safety

#### **2. Statistical Rigor**
- **Power analysis** to determine required sample sizes and test duration
- **Stratified randomization** to ensure balanced treatment assignment
- **Multiple testing corrections** when analyzing multiple metrics
- **Sequential testing** capabilities for early stopping decisions

#### **3. Business Context Integration**
- **Seasonal considerations** for temporal validity of results
- **Customer segment analysis** for heterogeneous treatment effects
- **Revenue impact modeling** for business case development
- **Risk assessment frameworks** for launch/no-launch decisions

### **Experimental Categories**
Below are some categories we will run experimentation on. The list is definitely not exhaustive as other kinds of tests should come up in the ordinary course of business.

#### ** E-commerce Optimization Experiments**
Revenue-focused tests that optimize the customer purchase journey:

- **Pricing Strategy Tests:** Free shipping thresholds, discount structures, dynamic pricing
- **User Experience Tests:** Checkout flow optimization, page layout variants, mobile UX
- **Product Discovery Tests:** Search algorithms, recommendation engines, category navigation

#### ** Machine Learning Experiments** 
Algorithm performance and model effectiveness testing:

- **Recommendation Systems:** Collaborative filtering vs. content-based vs. hybrid approaches
- **Personalization Algorithms:** Dynamic content, targeted messaging, adaptive interfaces
- **Predictive Model Validation:** Churn prediction, LTV modeling, demand forecasting

#### ** Growth & Engagement Experiments**
User behavior and retention optimization:

- **Onboarding Optimization:** User activation flows, tutorial effectiveness, feature adoption
- **Retention Strategies:** Email campaigns, push notification timing, engagement mechanics
- **Monetization Tests:** Subscription models, freemium conversion, pricing psychology

#### ** Advanced Statistical Methods**
Sophisticated experimental designs for complex business questions:

- **Multi-Armed Bandit Tests:** Dynamic allocation for continuous optimization
- **Factorial Designs:** Testing interaction effects between multiple variables
- **Difference-in-Differences:** Causal inference for policy changes and market interventions
- **Regression Discontinuity:** Natural experiments around threshold-based rules

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Power Analysis & Sample Size Calculation**
```python
# Sophisticated statistical planning
analyzer = ExperimentPowerAnalysis()
results = analyzer.assess_experiment_feasibility("free_shipping_threshold_test")

# Outputs: required sample size, test duration, calendar optimization (start-stop decision)
```

### **Experiment Configuration Management**
```yaml
# Comprehensive experiment specifications
experiments:
  free_shipping_threshold_test:
    hypothesis:
      primary: "8% conversion rate improvement"
      secondary: ["<5% AOV decrease acceptable"]
    
    eligibility_criteria: # Incorporate business logic to exclude certain kinds of users from the experiment
      include: ["new_customers", "returning_customers"]
      exclude: ["vip_customers", "employee_accounts"]
      
    stratification: # To ensure proper representation in both the control and treatment groups
      balance_across: ["customer_segment", "device_type", "geography"]
```

### **Statistical Analysis Pipeline**
```python
# Production-quality statistical testing
results = ExperimentAnalyzer.analyze_experiment(
    experiment_name="free_shipping_threshold_test",
    primary_metric="conversion_rate",
    alpha=0.05,
    multiple_testing_correction="bonferroni"
)

# Automated business recommendations
decision = BusinessDecisionFramework.make_recommendation(results)
```

##  **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.9+
- Statistical analysis libraries (scipy, statsmodels, numpy, pandas)
- Access to BigQuery for analysis data consumption
- Understanding of experimental design principles

### **Installation & Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whitehackr/flit-experiments.git
cd flit-experiments

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the configuration package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Validate installation
python -c "from flit_experiment_configs import get_experiment_config; print('✅ Setup complete')"
```

### **Quick Start: Your First Experiment**
```python
# 1. Design your experiment
from design.power_analysis import ExperimentPowerAnalysis

analyzer = ExperimentPowerAnalysis()
feasibility = analyzer.assess_experiment_feasibility("free_shipping_threshold_test")

# 2. Generate data (in flit-data-platform)

# This data generation is basically a simulaion of the experiment happening. In an ordinary (non-hypothetical) business env, this is basiclaly running the experiment

# 3. Analyze results
from analysis.experiment_analyzer import ExperimentAnalyzer

results = ExperimentAnalyzer.analyze_experiment("free_shipping_threshold_test")

# 4. Make business decision
from business.decision_framework import BusinessDecisionFramework

recommendation = BusinessDecisionFramework.make_recommendation(results)
